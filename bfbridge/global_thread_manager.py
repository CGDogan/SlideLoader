# Utility that can be used to store and reuse JVMs (or BioFormatsThread)
#Â for each thread in a global variable.
# Handles the case that fork() copies the address space; we shouldn't be
# tricked into thinking that we already have a JVM.

import threading

# What we need is keeping thread-local objects in a way that
# new threads that might even fork from it (https://stackoverflow.com/a/60807086)
# should not have access to it.
# Two ways to implement using threading.local:
# 1) store using a custom class and implement __copy__, __deepcopy__ (https://stackoverflow.com/q/1500718)
# to not copy anything to new threads (but how can we distinguish it from same-thread copies
# other than assuming that same-thread copies won't happen? Making copies a constructor call only)
# 2) Check the correct thread ID on every access
# The first one is faster but the second one is easier to code, which is what this file uses.

# Using threading.local is beneficial as its contents are freed, including
# calling the JVM destructor automatically when the thread exits
# ----
# our thread_local_object attributes: .o for object and .id for thread id
# "->" represents "implies"
# State invariant: Either
# 1) .id defined and correct -> .o defined and correct
# meaning: ready for retrieval
# 2) .id defined but not correct -> .o defined but not correct
# 3) .id not defined -> .o not defined or is incorrect
# these last two cases mean that new object construction is needed
thread_local_object = threading.local()

# Returns the thread local object if exists, otherwise returns None.
